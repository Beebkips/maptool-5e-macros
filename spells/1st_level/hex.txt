Also, choose one ability when you cast the spell. The target has disadvantage on ability checks made with the chosen ability.If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to curse a new creature.A remove curse cast on the target ends this spell early.
