A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.
