You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the target's soul isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature's race to change. The DM rolls a d100 and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the DM chooses a form.Reincarnate Racesd100Race01-04Dragonborn05-13Dwarf, hill14-21Dwarf, mountain22-25Elf, dark26-34Elf, high35-42Elf, wood43-46Gnome, forest47-52Gnome, rock53-56Half-elf57-60Half-orc61-68Halfling, lightfoot69-76Halfling, stout77-96Human97-00TieflingThe reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences.
